# dotfiles for my Arch Linux setup

## Apps

Current system relies on the following apps:

- polybar
- termite
- rxvt-unicode
- picom
- rofi
- ranger

## Fonts

I replace freetype2 with one with the cleartype patch, install `freetype2-cleartype` from the AUR.

The setup relies on the following fonts being install on Arch:
- `ttf-font-awesome` 
- `nerd-fonts-complete` (AUR) - this is massive, don't need them all
- `otf-san-francisco`
- `otf-sfmono`
- `otf-san-francisco-pro`
